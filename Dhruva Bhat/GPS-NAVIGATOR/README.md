# GPS Navigator

GPS Navigator is a web application designed to provide efficient navigation solutions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core functionality of this project is based on Dijkstra's algorithm, which enables the determination of the shortest distance between two locations on a map. Whether you're planning a road trip, a daily commute, or simply exploring new places, GPS Navigator has got you covered.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The web application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to input their starting and destination points.

- **Interactive Map:** The interactive map displays the available routes between the selected locations, highlighting the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.

- **Shortest Distance Calculation:** GPS Navigator utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate and display the shortest distance between the chosen locations, ensuring efficient route planning.

- **Visual Representation:** The application visually represents the recommended route, making it convenient for users to follow the path and reach their destination.

## How It Works

1. **Input Locations:** Enter your starting point and destination in the provided fields on the web application.

2. **Algorithm Processing:** The application processes your input using Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest route between the two locations.

3. **Route Visualization:** The recommended route is then displayed on the interactive map, showing each step of the journey.

4. **Distance Calculation:** GPS Navigator calculates and presents the exact distance between the chosen locations, helping you plan your travel time accurately.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the web page.
- CSS: Enhances the visual appeal and styling of the application.
- JavaScript: Implements the Dijkstra's algorithm for route calculation and map interaction.
